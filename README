Lattice
=======

Lattice is a Drop7 clone implemented in Ruby. It includes a very minimal console "game" for dev purposes.

Many features are not yet supported.

Tests
-----

Tests are done in test/unit, because it was fast.

Structure
---------

Pretty much all the code lives in the grid, or game board; most of the code works on arrays rather than objects. This was not a conscious decision, and might just be a hangover from writing too much Perl when I was younger. (Ah, the wild days...)
